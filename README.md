## Should be installed 
* Docker
* Docker-compose

## TO START APPLICATION
* $ make build
* $ make migrate
* $ make run

## API DOC URL
localhost:8000/api/doc

## Explain part
* I've used pandas to manipulate with caching file
* Bs to parse html, cause it's handy
* async aiohttp web library, it's lightweight
* swagger for api documentation
* Also i've containerized application for easy use


## Improvements
* Search by part of name, catefory (text search)
* Cache by parts (for ex by categories to file)


## Flow
* you start application
* run swagger on it's url and use examples, or use Postman to send http requests
